## Help FAQ
  * Can't knit NYPD data analysis? Wait. It's huge. It'll take about ten minutes.
  * Can I use these as my own project basis?
      + Please don't just copy these and get yourself in deep water, but feel free to think about these incredibly simple and not very unique conclusions and do a deeper analysis of your own.
      + Also feel free to read or play with the John Hopkins data analysis to learn more about tidyverse, since I included very thorough documentation about each and every step.
